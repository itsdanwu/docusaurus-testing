##### About Metropolis' Build Permit NFTs.

---

Metropolis is currently in limited beta. This means that we’re slowly opening up access to DAOs and organizations to create digital cities with pods. This process looks as follows.

- Each week, five new DAOs will be invited to join the Metropolis. This invite comes in the form of a “Build Permit” NFT, which will be airdropped to the Gnosis Safe multi-sigs associated with these DAOs.
- Simply by being a signer on a Gnosis Safe that holds a Build Permit, you gain access to Metropolis.
- Gaining access to Metropolis means you have full access to our app. You can create a new pod or podify *any* Gnosis Safe that you are a signer of — not just the Safe that holds the Build Permit.

To check if one of your Safes received a Build Permit NFT, go to [pod.xyz](http://pod.xyz) and connect with a wallet. If you did not yet receive an airdrop or are unsure, you can submit a request using this [typeform](https://form.typeform.com/to/RwsN2JXs).
