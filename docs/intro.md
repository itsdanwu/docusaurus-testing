## What Is Metropolis?

Metropolis is an extensible and modular DAO implementation, built around small working groups called pods. Each pod has a Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet, which is controlled by the pod members through a proposal-approval mechanism.
Pods use a lightweight approval mechanism to vote on and execute transactions. The UI is focused on pod member management and the display of pod composability. 

## Build Permit NFTs

Metropolis is currently in limited beta. This means that we’re slowly opening up access to DAOs and organizations to create digital cities with pods. This process looks as follows.

- Each week, five new DAOs will be invited to join the Metropolis. This invite comes in the form of a “Build Permit” NFT, which will be airdropped to the Gnosis Safe multi-sigs associated with these DAOs.
- Simply by being a signer on a Gnosis Safe that holds a Build Permit, you gain access to Metropolis.
- Gaining access to Metropolis means you have full access to our app. You can create a new pod or podify *any* Gnosis Safe that you are a signer of — not just the Safe that holds the Build Permit.

To check if one of your Safes received a Build Permit NFT, go to [pod.xyz](http://pod.xyz) and connect with a wallet. If you did not yet receive an airdrop or are unsure, you can submit a request [here](https://pod.xyz).
