##### How to integrate with the Metropolis SDK.

---

At a high level, the Metropolis SDK allows developers to:
* Fetch and determine if addresses are pods
* Fetch pod metadata
* Fetch pod member data, including member pods. 
* Determine roles of pod members
* Mint and burn pod membership, either directly acting as a manager or through a proposal. 

If you prefer, you can view auto-generated docs of our [complete SDK here](https://orcaprotocol.github.io/orca-sdk/).

## Initialize the SDK

To begin, initialize the SDK with the init function:

```js
import { init } from '@orcaprotocol/orca-sdk';

// Any ethers provider works.
// 1 for mainnet, 4 for rinkeby.
// Make sure that the provider is instantiated before the SDK
init({ provider: ethers.getDefaultProvider(), network: 1 });
```
