##### How to create a Metropolis pod.
---


Creating a pod is simple and can be done through the Metropolis web app.

## 1. Navigate to Metropolis app

You can access the Metropolis web app at https://pod.xyz/.

## 2. Pod name and membership NFT
Once logged in to the app, click the "Create" button on the top nav bar to enter the Create Pod flow.

The first step is to set a pod name and set the NFT image for your pod. The pod name will be appended with .pod.xyz (i.e., myPod.pod.xyz) which will become the publicly accessible ENS domain for your pod.

Your NFT image should have a 1:1 ratio and 800x800px max. This NFT image is the visual representation of your pod membership.
