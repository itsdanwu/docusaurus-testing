##### Information for Metropolis Beta users.

---

We’ve chosen a select group of DAOs to have access to our beta. For those that do currently have access to Metropolis, please see our quick rundown and instructions below for new users. 

## Supercharge your Gnosis Safe

> Pods = Gnosis Safe multi-sig with a permissions layer for managing signers.
>
> It’s a simple — but powerful — primitive, that supercharges your Gnosis Safe.
> 
> **1) All your Safes in one interface**
> Proposals across all your multi-sigs are aggregated into one interface ‒ making it easy for signers to quickly approve transactions.
> 
> **2) Manage signers with zero fuss**
> With admin capabilities and NFTs for managing signers, mass onboarding and off-boarding contributors is simple.
> 
> **3) Give your Safe an identity**
> No need to waste time and energy identifying multi-sig addresses. Every pod has a unique NFT, ENS name, and matching URL.
> 
> The best part? Pods don’t change your Gnosis Safe—they just give it superpowers.

## How It Works

Our smart contracts do not interact with, or have access to, the assets in your Gnosis Safe. These contracts can only manage who is a signer on your Safe.

Metropolis contracts have been independently audited by Consensys Dilligence, Quantstamp, and the internal auditors at Gnosis Safe.

## Next Steps

Beta access means you can:

1. **Enable the pod module for existing Gnosis Safes**
    
    *Note: enabling the pod module requires approval from multi-sig signers. Feel free to share this page with other signers to make the process of enabling pods smoother.*
    
2. **Create new pods** (which creates a new Gnosis Safe with the pod module enabled from the start)

You can do all of this through our interface at [pod.xyz](https://pod.xyz/).

## What’s Coming

Standalone pods are powerful tools, but they’re even more powerful when you click them together. From pod templates to a visual podarchy builder, we can’t wait for you to see what we’ve got in store. Make sure you’re following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/metropolis) to stay updated on all things pods.
